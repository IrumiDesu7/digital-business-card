        After deciding that I want to be a full stack developer and try learning
        it, I realized that web development is a passion to me and I really love
        doing it. So I set myself to learn everyday to be better and I believe
        that progress is always a good thing even if itâ€™s just a little
        progress. So here I am pursuing my dream to become a full-stack
        developer.
